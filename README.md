# MVC Intro

The master branch contains a simple controller with action methods to illustrate 
* using ViewBag to pass data to a view
* using URL query string parameters to get data from the browser
* using models to pass data to a view
* using forms and model binding to get user input

The Product model provides the structure of data objects used in the examples

The EntityFramework branch adds persistence and shows scaffolded code generated by the framework, including all of the CRUD operations
